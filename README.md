# DataVizWorkshop

A tutorial based on [Complete Guide to Data Visualization with Python](https://towardsdatascience.com/complete-guide-to-data-visualization-with-python-2dd74df12b5e), formatted as follow-along workshop instead of article.


### Repo Structure:
* `datasets/` is the folder with all of the data files required for the workshop.
* `slides/` is the folder for both the pdf of the slide deck and the link to the google slides presentation, as well as the built html sites from the code in the jupyter notebook.
* `code/` is the folder with all the supplemental code, including some extra references/resources to share with students. This is also where the notebook to run the majority of the workshop lives.
